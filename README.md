# FairTickets
A program that distributes tickets in a line fairly. That is, each person can only buy a second ticket after everyone else has bought at least one, and each person can only buy a third one after everyone else has bought a second one, and so on. The program implements linked lists created from scratch instead of using the inbuilt one.
